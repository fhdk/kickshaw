0.5.4 2017-12-16
  * Bugfix - If several rows were selected for drag & drop and before 
    doing the drag & drop action they were clicked on (again), it could 
    happen that after the drag & drop process it was no longer possible to 
    select a row.
  * Bugfix (regression) - Context menu headlines were not styled under 
    certain conditions.
  * Minor changes.

0.5.3 2017-12-13
  * Minor/cosmetical changes; no bugfixes.

0.5.2 2017-12-11
  * Error message for the case that there is no window system running 
    is now sent to stderr.
  * Minor/cosmetical fixes/changes.

0.5.1 2017-12-10
  * Bugfix (regression) - If the column checkboxes in the find grid had a
    red background color because a search was done without choosing at 
    least one column and the find grid was closed afterwards, the
    background color was not removed. The same goes for the entry field.
  * Fixed memory leaks.

0.5.0 2017-12-09

  * Bugfix (regression) - Entries of single fields completed with "return" 
    and not by clicking on the "Done" button are working properly again.
  * Bugfix (regression) - Visualisation of menus/items without label 
    from the dialog is working again.
  * Bugfix (regression) - Invalid attributes are rejected again.
  * Leading and trailing whitespace of text of options is now removed.
  * The dialog texts for fixing invisible and orphaned menus do no 
    longer exceed the requested width.
  * Corrected position of GNU macros.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

0.5 RC3 2017-12-04

  * If an option with an invalid value is found during the loading 
    process, the error message now includes line, line no. and the item to 
    which this option belongs to.
  * Indentations inside the menu file are now done with tabulators.
  * The accelerators for expanding and collapsing the treeview have been 
    changed to <Ctrl><Shift><X> and <C> so they don't interfere with 
    the common shortcuts <Ctrl><X> and <C>. Accelerators for Move Top,
    Move Up, Move Down, Move Bottom and Remove have been added.
  * If the selection of columns, the setting for case matching or for   
    the usage of regular expressions is changed during a search and the 
    results include matches inside currently hidden columns, these 
    columns are now shown, as it was already the case when the search 
    term was entered.
  * If the icon theme is changed and the tree view contains the system 
    icons indicating a wrong path for an icon file (=system icon for 
    "question") and/or an unrecognisable image format (=system icon for 
    "missing image"), these icons are updated to the new icon theme.
  * Added some conditional compilation to prevent compiler warnings 
    because of deprecated GTK functions. Deprecation warnings should 
    no longer appear, since the development of GTK3 has come to an end in 
    favor of GTK4.
  * Bugfix (regression) - For some editing actions the list of search 
    results was reset after the sensivity of tool- and menu bar items 
    had been reset, which could result in a wrong sensivity for the back 
    and forth buttons inside the find grid after an editing action.
  * Bugfix (regression) - If an invalid value for an option was corrected 
    during the loading process, the menu could not be saved back directly 
    after loading was finished, "Save as" had to be used instead prior to 
    a first change done to the menu.
  * Bugfix - Fixed possible crash that could occur when a label of a 
    separator was erased.
  * Bugfix - During the loading process, pipe menus without label received 
    an erroneous "invisible item" element visibility status if they had no 
    invisible parents. Menu ids of such pipe menus positioned at toplevel 
    were shown as "(null)" inside the dialog that warned about menus and 
    items without a label. The same erroneous designation happened... 
    ...if a row had a descendant with such a labelless pipe menu and that 
       row was dragged and the pipe menu had no invisible parent after the 
       dragging. 
    ...If a visualisation was done of another menu element and there was 
       a labelless pipe menu with an invisible ancestor affected by this, 
       in a way that its ancestor received a label.
  * Bugfix - If an invalid value for an enabled or prompt value appeared 
    inside an unlabeled item, the corresponding error message showed the 
    item label as '(null)' instead of leaving it out.
  * Bugfix - If an invalid icon path is corrected or an invalid icon file 
    is replaced with a valid one during the loading process, the menu can 
    now be saved back directly after loading is finished.
  * Bugfix - If several rows were selected and another row with an icon 
    was rightclicked, the context menu showed a "Remove icons" item in 
    addition to the "Remove icon" one.
  * Bugfix - If, after an error had occured during the creation of an 
    icon, another icon file was chosen and a creation of an icon was also 
    impossible, the path was not updated in the headline above the error 
    message. The original path is now only replaced if an icon creation 
    is successful; if the situation above occures the new chosen file 
    path will no longer replace the old one if a creation of an icon 
    proves unsuccessful from it.
  * Bugfix - If a text was entered for a single startupnotify field
    after the entry field had been left blank before and the entry field 
    had thus been coloured red, the same startupnotify field would show 
    up coloured if choosen again.
  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

0.5 RC2 2013-09-28

  * Added some global keyboard accelerators.
  * Entry of empty labels for menus, pipe menus and items is now blocked, 
    since this would result in an invisible menu element. This also fixes 
    the bug that after the entry of an empty label the element visibility 
    was not updated. Menus with invisible elements can still be loaded.
  * A new separator does not have a label by default now, since a separator 
    is always visible anyway.
  * If entry fields/buttons for a new action or option are shown, the 
    (first) field/button now grabs the focus.
  * If opening a new menu fails and there is still one currently in memory, 
    the latter is no longer cleared. 
  * If deprecated "execute" options have been found and automatically 
    converted to "command" options, the program now makes clear that these 
    changes haven't been written back to file yet. The "save" button/menu 
    item is activated then so the user can save the file without applying 
    any other changes.
  * If the font size is changed, the columns are now autoresized so in case 
    there are icons and the font size is reduced, the resulting space 
    between the icons and the following text is removed.
  * Empty strings as search results are no longer considered to be a valid 
    match.
  * Removed GTK version check (This was added back again in the final 0.5, 
    since there is actually code that needs a GTK version GTK > 3.0).
  * Bugfix - The actions for "Visualise" and "Visualise recursively" from 
    the menu bar were inverted.
  * Bugfix - If several rows were selected and another row was 
    rightclicked, in some cases the context menu didn't have the full set 
    of choices that was supposed to be displayed.
  * Bugfix - If a menu can't be saved via "Save as" due to an error that 
    occured during saving process, the filename is no longer replaced with 
    the chosen one.
  * Bugfix (regression) - After a submenu/-item had been dragged out of an 
    invisible orphaned menu to toplevel, this menu/item was marked as 
    invisible even if it had a label.
  * Bugfix - Orphaned pipe menus were not saved.
  * Bugfix - If a menu that included items with empty icon paths was 
    loaded, these paths were not saved back again.
  * Bugfix - If a row and at least one of its descendants were selected, 
    the descendant was always called "child" regardless of the hierarchy. 
    If an option of an action other than "Execute" and an option 
    of "startupnotify" were selected at the same time, the action was 
    mistakenly displayed as "Execute" action in the statusbar.
  * Bugfix - If the "new action/option" combo box is shown and a search 
    was still active, the treeview is redrawn so the highlighting of 
    search results disappears immediately (it disappeared only when the 
    mouse went over the respective rows).
  * Bugfix - If the path of an icon image had become invalid and thus 
    the icon was replaced with the "invalid icon path" icon, the 
    modification date was not erased internally.
  * Bugfix - If a menu is saved, the menu bar "save" item is now also 
    greyed out.
  * Bugfix - If at least one row that was eligible for recursive 
    visualisation was selected and at least another one that wasn't, the 
    menu bar item "Visualise recursively" was activated, but "Visualise"
    wasn't.
  * Bugfix - If an invisible menu, pipe menu, item or separator was 
    visualised, the sensivity of the menu bar item for visualisation 
    was not updated.
  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code. More comments were added to the source code to help with the 
    comprehension of it.

0.5 RC 2013-08-22

  New functionality:

  * Automatic reconfiguration of Openbox if the menu is saved at the 
    standard location (~/.config/openbox/menu.xml) and kickshaw is 
    currently run under Openbox. 
  * Added a timer function that checks for moved/deleted/renamed icon
    files and for a change of font size.
    If an icon gets moved/deleted/renamed during program runtime the icon 
    inside the treestore will replaced with a broken icon image. If the 
    treestore contains a broken icon image, but during program runtime 
    an external change makes icon path pointing to a valid icon, the 
    broken icon will replaced with the proper icon image.
    If font size is changed during program runtime, the icon images 
    will be recreated to fit to the new font size.
  * The deprecated <execute> tag is now automatically converted to a 
    <command> tag.
  * "--version" passed as an argument will now display the program 
    version.

  Misc improvements and changes

  * Usage of a real XML-Parser (GLib's Simple XML Subset Parser) for 
    enhanced flexibility and reliability.
  * Menus inside root-menu are now supported, too, in previous versions 
    their sub-content had to be defined outside the root-menu, in the 
    way shown for example by the provided sample menu.
  * Duplicate menu IDs are now already prevented at loading stage.
  * Menu field texts are now escaped by the program so the user 
    doesn't have to bother about this.
  * The display of found search terms has been improved, instead of 
    highlighting the whole content of a cell with a found occurrence, 
    only the exact section matching the search term is now highlighted.
  * Not just invisible toplevel menus are now highlighted, this applies 
    now to all menus, pipe menus, items and separators regardless their 
    position inside the menu (highlighting still can be deactivated).
  * Interactive search provided by GTK has been deactivated, since 
    kickshaw provides its own search functionality.
  * SVG image files are no longer filtered out by the "add icon" file
    chooser dialog, since the support for SVG icons was added by 
    Openbox 3.5.1.
  * There are now two different system icons indicating icon creation 
    failures, one for invalid icon paths and one for icon files that 
    are corrupted or otherwise unusable. Furthermore they are singled 
    out by two red exclamation marks behind them to make them easily 
    distinguishable from normal icons.
  * The program no longer exits after it detected an error inside the 
    menu file, it now reverts to a initial state with an empty menu.
  * Restricted display of headlines for context menus to cases where 
    two different kinds of options are available, resulting in a cleaner 
    look. Exception: the mouse is right-clicked outside the tree.
  * Made key file standard compliant.
  * Choosing an action won't block the treeview anymore, some events 
    and widgets are still deactivated in this case though, because 
    they contradict the choice (i.e. removing rows). If another row 
    is selected, the action/option combobox is automatically closed 
    and the old status is reestablished.
  * Set the initial focus to the treeview so the "New menu" tool button 
    is no longer focused after the start of the program. The text entry 
    field of the find box now grabs focus when it is displayed, enabling 
    an immediate input.
  * To maintain the default settings equal to the ones of Openbox, a new 
    "enabled" option of a "startupnotify" option is now set to "no".
  * Allowed saving empty menus again, since they don't evoke an error 
    inside Openbox. 
  * Added a note for "make uninstall" that the settings file has to be 
    removed manually. Extended messages for problems with the settings 
    file (the location of the file and whether it was during writing or 
    reading).
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

  Bugfixes:

  * For load menu part:
    - Corrected wrong error message for the case that an XML tag is put 
      before an opening <openbox_menu> tag.
    - If a menu contained no toplevel menus, which means that just 
      the root menu was populated with elements, and the first root 
      menu element was a separator, the separator was wrongly reported 
      to be at an iappropriate position.
    - A self-closing action tag that was placed after an action tag of 
      the same kind was wrongly reported to be at an inappropriate 
      position.
    - If a completely empty menu is loaded, ie. a menu with nothing 
      between the <openbox_menu> tags, the appropriate error message is 
      now displayed ("Root Menu not found!").
    - An open find box is now closed, since remaining search results 
      from the previous menu could result in a crash when using the 
      activated results navigation buttons. This fix applies to new 
      menus, too.
  * If a subrow of another row and a toplevel row was dragged, it 
    resulted in a crash, if the subrow was placed on top of the other one.
  * If a broken icon path is replaced by a valid one during the loading 
    phase, the broken icon path is now replaced by the valid one inside 
    the treestore and thus shown inside the treeview.
  * During the saving process the iter of a selected row was modified, 
    which could result in undesired behaviour and/or error messages 
    if something was done with this selected row.
  * (Regession) If dragging is disabled for one or more reasons shown in 
    the status bar, a new selection resets the dragging status to 
    draggable again before a new check is done whether a blocking should 
    be applied again.
  * Removal of all children from a node now works also if the node is 
    collapsed.
  * It was possible to drag a menu and an item that was placed in a 
    submenu of the former at the same time, since only the first sublevel 
    of a menu was checked for selections. Now every descendant (if exists) 
    of a selected row is checked if it is also selected.
  * Removed some possibilities to place a dragged row at an inappropriate 
    position.
  * Font size is now also parsed correctly if the font name consists of 
    more than one word (this bug resulted in wrong icon sizes).
  * If a menu ID was changed twice in a row via the entry field without 
    selecting another row in between, the program was crashing. 
  * If several rows were selected and one of their cells was edited 
    directly inside the treeview, a crash resulted.
  * In the case that after the deletion of rows a selection remains 
    active, during a drag and drop action all rows are unselected after 
    the old source rows have been removed.
  * Icon Pixbuf wasn't reset to NULL after an icon has been added to the 
    menu (now irrelevant, since the code was rewritten).
  * After a new menu has been loaded, sensitivity of menu bar items and 
    tool buttons is now reset (for example "Collapse all nodes" is greyed 
    out).
  * If a new Execute action was added below a selected Exit or 
    SessionLogout action the prompt option of startupnotify (if it was 
    used) was not added to the treeview and -store. A similar situation 
    appeared when a new Execute action was added below a selected Restart 
    action, in this case the command option of startupnotify was not added.
    (Both scenarios are very unlikely to affect someone, because such an 
    order of actions makes no sense so almost nobody would use it. But 
    since actions can be added in free order, this has been fixed anyway.)
  * If a new startupnotify option was added, the startupnotify node was 
    collapsed and autosorting of options was deactivated, then the new 
    option wasn't selected.
  * If autosorting was disabled and an option of Execute was chosen for 
    addition, in certain cases they were added as last element instead 
    of being inserted after the selected position.
  * If a new icon is added via entering its path into the icon path entry 
    field, the "remove icon" button is now activated.
  * If all rows were deleted (not via the "New menu" button), the 
    "Save as..." button wasn't deactivated afterwards.
  * If several icons were removed at the same time, the internal variable 
    for an applied change wasn't set, so the "save" tool button was not 
    unlocked in case there was a file name set.
  * If one of the columns "Menu ID" or "Execute" was hidden and a search 
    found a match in one of them on toplevel, these columns were not 
    expanded to visualise this find.
  * If both the entry field and the column check boxes of the find grid 
    were highlighted because of a missing choice and either the "match 
    case" or "regular expression" check box was clicked afterwards, 
    the highlighting of the column check boxes was reverted.
  * Settings file is now closed after it had been opened for reading.
  * Fixed memory leaks.
  * The problem of undesired dragging that occured when a row was simply
    clicked but not yet dragged (probably on slower machines) has been 
    solved.

0.5 Beta 3 2011-12-18
  * Bugfix (regression) - Inserting a Reconfigre action via the context 
    menu is working again.
  * Bugfix - If an empty item (closed with "/>") is follöwed by another 
    item, the position of the latter is no longer reported as erroneous.
  * Bugfix - Added autoresizing of columns if icons are (de)activated, 
    since otherwise icons are not shown if they were deactivated at start 
    time and their display is activated later on.
  * Bugfix - If a search with an empty entry was started (resulting in the 
    entry field being marked to indicate that a search term is obligatory) 
    and the "All columns" button was activated and deactivated again, all 
    rows and columns were marked as hits, this behaviour has been reverted 
    so no rows and columns are marked now in this case.
  * Minor changes.

0.5 Beta 2 2011-12-11
  * Created special text layout for error messages regarding an invalid 
    menu.
  * More (and more differentiated) error messages for invalid menus. 
  * Bugfix - Line numbers were not reset for the root menu parsing stage.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

0.5 Beta 2011-12-08
  * Ported application to GTK 3.
  * Added search functionality (incl. processing of regular expressions).
  * Added support for icons (introduced first in Openbox 3.5.0).
  * Added checks for XML-validty and Openbox menu format compliance.
  * If there are multiple elements inside an xml tag of an openbox menu 
    file, they can now be arranged in any order.
  * Added "Remove children" option to the menu bar and context menu.
  * Added "Move top/bottom" menu items to the menu bar.
  * The application window can now be shrinked.
  * Bugfix - Safer xml parsing. Kickshaw will no longer get "confused" 
    because of menu files that contain lines such as 
    '<menu id="<separator ">'.
  * If two rows are selected and another one (not one of these two) is 
    rightclicked, the two previously selected ones are now unselected, 
    the new one is selected and the context menu for it is shown. If 
    a row is selected and afterwards a blank area outside the treeview 
    is rightclicked, the row is unselected and the context menu is shown 
    that would have been shown if the blank area would have been clicked 
    without having previously selected a row.
  * If the last visible row was clicked and it had more entry fields 
    than a previous clicked one, the former one was overlapped by the 
    uppopping entry fields. This is now avoided by scrolling the treeview 
    to this row after the popup of the entry fields.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

0.4.9 2011-12-08
  * Bugfix - A variable for a currently active action is now only set if 
    this action is not closed immediately (this is usually the case with 
    a Reconfigure action). If another action was started after such an 
    immediately closed one, a memory leak appeared, this has been fixed.

0.4.8 2011-11-10
  * Bugfix - Pipe menus from root menu are now parsed properly.
  * Bugfix - Icon paths inside an item tag are now ignored and no longer 
    corrupt the label text (support for icons is introduced in version 
    0.5).
  * Bugfix - Memory leak fixed.
  * Bugfix - Missing line break added in the list of unused root menus 
    (missing only when there was just one unused root menu).

0.4.7 2011-11-07
  * Bugfix (regression) - If the display status of grid lines had been 
    changed the settings file was no longer updated.

0.4.6 2011-11-06
  * Bugfix (regression) - Fixed corruption of file name.

0.4.5 2011-10-21
  * Bugfix - Memory leak that occured when a file was already open and a 
    new one was opened afterwards fixed.

0.4.4 2011-10-10
  * Removal of redundant code.

0.4.3 2011-10-10
  * Bugfix - The table for the entry fields that is shown when a row is 
    selected was defined with a redundant row, this bug had no effect on 
    the program and its appearance.

0.4.2 2011-09-25
  * Bugfix - Setting of sensivity of collpase/expand toolbar buttons and 
    menu items is now also working correctly if rows are selected that 
    are part of an expanded treeview.
  * If an obligatory entry field had not been filled out, but it later 
    received a proper content, the background color of this field was set 
    from rose to white (not visible until this entry field was shown 
    again), now it is simply reset to the previous state, so it does not 
    override a theme that uses another color than white.

0.4.1 2011-09-24
  * Removal of redundant code.

0.4 2011-09-18
  * Boolean values are now shown as toggle buttons directly inside the 
    treeview and can be changed by toggling these buttons.
  * Added a view option to (de)activate tree lines. Tree lines are now 
    shown by default.
  * It's now possible to remove rows via the "Delete" key.
  * When adding an action, mandatory fields can no longer be left empty, 
    if "Done" is pressed, these fields are now marked with a rose 
    background. The same applies for options of startupnotify when they 
    were chosen via the combo box.
  * If there is only one entry field to be filled out for a new menu 
    element, it is now enough to press the "Enter" key to finish 
    entering, it is no longer necessary to click the "Done" button.
  * Safer check for non-existing root menu. The program does no longer 
    exit after it displays the error message that no root menu has been 
    found.
  * When a menu is loaded, prompt options of an Exit or SessionLogout 
    action with a value other than "yes" or "no" will no longer be 
    accepted, the user is asked to choose one of the possible values.
  * The "Save" option in the menu bar is now deactivated as well if a 
    menu (without changes during the loading process) was loaded or a 
    new menu was created. Save (As) is also deactivated in the case a 
    new menu was created or there are currently no rows.
  * It is now possible to add new rows into unused menus. The status of 
    the latter is regularised in this case.
  * Expand and collapse all nodes tool bar buttons and menu bar entries 
    are now disabled if the menu is empty or there are no subrows.
    The above-mentioned changes also apply for the case that no menu.xml 
    file exists in ~/.config/openbox, kickshaw starts as before with an 
    empty menu. The tool bar buttons are also enabled or disabled 
    according to whether all nodes are collapsed, at least one but not 
    all are expanded or all are expanded.
  * For new basic menu elements (menu, pipe menu, item and separator) 
    the label is now uniformly set as "New xxx" (xxx = type).
  * If it is chosen to create a new menu and the prior menu has been 
    emptied, there is now a note inside the appearing warning message 
    that empty menus won't be saved anyway.
  * Error messages are now presented in bold text.
  * The make file has been modified to work also on BSD. It now also 
    contains options for optimisation, extra warnings and pedantic check 
    for compliance with the C99 standard (incl. GNU extensions).
  * Bugfix - Menu IDs of submenus were deleted inside the interal list 
    during a drag and drop process. Menu IDs are now recorded in the 
    internal list also for unused menus, preventing double menu IDs of 
    unused and regular or invisible menus. If invisible menus are 
    deleted during the loading process, their menu IDs are now also
    erased from the internal list.
  * Bugfix - If invisible menus were found during the loading process 
    and it was chosen to delete them, the paths of Execute actions of 
    these menus were not removed properly from the internal list.
  * Bugfix - It the last menu element was an item and the second to last 
    a menu, the menu file was not created properly.
  * Bugfix - startupnotify is now inserted with option block as type.
  * Bugfix - If nothing had been selected before and the context menu 
    was activated, the function for the latter always received a value 
    of zero currently selected rows, resulting in inappropriate options 
    inside the context menu.
  * Bugfix - If a drag and drop process was finished, it was not set 
    internally that a change occured so the save button was not unlocked 
    if the drag and drop process was the first action done after a menu 
    was loaded. There was also no update on the selection status, which 
    led to the situation that the possible options for the old position 
    were still shown for the new position, which could result in a crash 
    when trying to activate one of them.
  * Bugfix - If a menu, item or separator was assigned a value for its 
    label that was equal to that of an action or option identifier 
    crashes or severe malfunctions occured.
  * Bugfix - Toplevel pipe menus are now assigned as "regular" for their 
    toplevel menu status if they are not unused or invisble.
  * Bugfix - Obligatory sentinels were missing in a few function calls.
  * Bugfix - Removed the label in front of the combo box that is shown 
    when several actions or options are possible because it was actually 
    superfluous and not flexible ("Action" was shown even if it was an 
    option of an action).
  * Bugfix - General additions to the program to avoid memory leaks.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

0.4 RC 2 2011-07-31

  * If a menu ID was edited, an already existing ID entered and the same 
    row clicked afterwards, after the error message a drag and drop 
    process was started due to interfering code, this situation is now 
    avoided.
  * Bugfix - When (pipe) menus were dragged, their menu IDs of the source 
    rows were deleted, but not replaced for the new rows.
  * Code optimisation, minor/cosmetical changes and removal of redundant 
    code.

0.4 RC 2011-07-30

  * If a menu file is overwritten, a backup file is now created, its name 
    is the old file name plus an attached tilde.
  * Options in the edit menu (not only the corresponding ones in the 
    toolbar) are now deactivated as well if they don't make sense (for 
    example "move down" when the last row is selected).
  * If rows are moved via drag and drop and one or more of them are nodes, 
    the expansion status of these nodes and all subnodes are now kept.
  * If a new action is chosen to be added to an item, instead of blocking 
    the whole treeview only further selections are blocked, since this 
    has the advantage that the selection can be still displayed.
  * Actions or options of actions are now inserted throughout at the 
    current selection position, with the remaining execption when they 
    are added directly at the parent node.
  * Recursive expansion of selected nodes is now always possible as long 
    as not every subnode has been expanded so far. In addition an 
    exclusive expansion of all immediate children can now always be 
    chosen as long as this kind of expansion is not already active.
  * The workaround for the problem that a multiple selection of rows 
    disappeared when the rows were dragged interfered with editable cells 
    in a way that the editing of such cells was much harder to activate. 
    This interference is now avoided.
  * Bugfix - If the content of cells is changed via the entry fields 
    displayed at the bottom, the "save" button is now activated in any 
    case.
  * Bugfix - command and prompt options of an Execute action can no 
    longer be moved into other Execute actions if there are already 
    options of the same kind.
  * Bugfix - If at least one unused or invisible menu is selected and 
    the context menu is opened, the correct general text "Regularise 
    menu statuses" is now displayed instead of "Generate empty menus".
  * Code optimisation and removal of redundant code.

0.4 Beta 4 2011-07-23

  * Added multirow drag and drop.
  * Added a status bar for drag and drop information.
  * Added a GTK version check (GTK 2.>=18 req.)
  * Bugfix - the check for menus that dragged into themselves is now also 
    in effect when the menus are moved more than a level deeper in a tree 
    (this bug was irrelevant, since the check for an irrelevant position 
    led to a break before).
  * Bugfix (regression) - if an action or startupnotify was selected, 
    toggling the status of an "enabled" option was afterwards no longer 
    possible.
  * Minor code optimisations, removal of redundant code and cosmetical 
    changes.

0.4 Beta 3 2011-07-17

  * The identifiers in .kickshawrc are now identical to the texts of the 
    menu items, so settings that were changed from the defaults have to 
    be redone.
  * Bugfix - Memory of string disassembling array was not freed after use.
  * Some code rewriting, most of it resulting in more compact code.

0.4 Beta 2 2011-07-15

  * It is now possible to drop rows onto other rows, they are added as a 
    new last child of the row they are dropped upon.
  * When a new file is created or loaded after a previous one, the treeview 
    columns are now autosized. The same applies to collapsing rows via the 
    context menu.
  * Bugfix - Moving an option to an action that has already the same option 
    is now prevented. It is now also being prevented that a prompt option 
    with a value other than "yes" and "no" is moved into an "Exit" or 
    "SessionLogout" action.
  * Bugfix - Options are now autosorted when having been moved via drag and 
    drop and if autosorting is activated.
  * Bugfix - Unused or invisible menus are being dealt with properly now 
    when they are part of a drag and drop process.
  * Bugfix - Prompt options can now be moved into SessionLogout actions.
    (This bug was irrelevant, since dropping onto empty rows had not been 
    implemented yet.)
  * Bugfix - Memory of string disassembling array was not freed after use.
  * The README file had not been updated with the drag_and_drop file.
  * Code optimisation, minor changes and removal of redundant code.

0.4 Beta 2011-07-13

  * Solved the problem that dropping was done one row before the marked 
    dropped zone if the dragged row was shown with more than its upper half 
    above the marking.
  * Added expand/collapse row in context menu for convenience.
  * Moved the settings file from ~/.config/openbox/menu_editor_settings 
    to ~/.kickshawrc, since this is no file created by Openbox itself and 
    the settings file is easier to detect this way.
  * Code optimsation and removal of redundant code.

0.4 Alpha 2011-07-11

  * Added drag and drop functionality. Limitation for now: if multiple 
    elements are selected, only the first one is moved.
  * Minor code rewriting and optimisation.
  * Renamed application to "kickshaw".

0.3.14 2011-07-08

  * Bugfix - If not located on a toplevel, a separator without a label still 
    received a label="" in the xml file because of outdated code that had 
    not been removed until now.
  * Code optimisation, also removal of redundant code.

0.3.13 2011-07-07

  * Bugfix - If a boolean field inside the tree view was selected, a variable 
    was set internally that a change was done, even without one actually done, 
    so a question would appear when leaving the program or creating a new/
    opening another file whether to continue dispite unsaved changes.
    The same applies for text fields, if there has been no change or the same 
    value was entered, the variable is no longer set.

0.3.12 2011-07-06

  * Bugfix - If a Menu ID cell was edited directly in the tree view, the 
    new value was shown, but the old value was still kept internally in the 
    list of Menu ID, which could result in double Menu IDs if new ones were
    added.
  * Some code rewriting and optimisation.

0.3.11 2010-12-06

  * Bugfix - If all root menus without content were selected for deletion
    during the loading phase of the menu and one of these menus was next
    to another one, the second one was not deleted because the rows were
    not deleted via the row references method.
  * If menus without corresponding entries in the root menu and/or root 
    menus without content are initialised or deleted, the menu can now be 
    saved directly right from the start with the save toolbar button without 
    using the save as toolbutton as "workaraound", since the menu has 
    already been changed.
  * Minor/cosmetical changes.

0.3.10 2010-12-05

  * Faster check if a given value exists in a list of strings (streq_any 
    function), returns TRUE immediately now if it has been found.
  * Compressed code for sorting of execute and startupnotify options.
  * Minor/cosmetical changes.

0.3.9 2010-11-28

  * Bugfix - If a menu was saved a second time, the root menu wasn't created 
    correctly, because some variables were not properly reset after the first 
    save.
  * Bugfix - The removal of the "(No label)" indicator wasn't done at one 
    place in the code so separators without label were not written correctly.
  * Bugfix - If a cell has been edited, the entry fields are now immediately 
    updated. The "save" toolbutton is now shown if this modification was done 
    as first modification after the start of the program.

0.3.8 2010-11-20

  * Removed the "(No label)" indicator for separators without a label to 
    make it equal with the other elements and since this is obvious in the 
    tree view anyway.

0.3.7 2010-11-20

  * Cleaner look for the context menu.
  * Added the possibility to regularise the status of several unused or 
    invisible toplevel menus via the context menu.
  * Minor code cleanup.

0.3.6 2010-11-18

  * Added the possibilty to regularise an unused or invisible toplevel menu
    via the context menu.
  * Removed the possibility to change a toplevel menu status to invisible 
    or unused. Even though this can be done by editing the menu xml file by 
    hand, this is something that would usually not be considered as a useful 
    option inside a program.
  * Bugfix - Menus that are inserted as a sub element of a toplevel menu no 
    longer unnecessarily receive a value for the toplevel menu status. 
  * Minor/cosmetical changes and code cleanup.

0.3.5 2010-11-18

  * Labels of unused toplevel menus can no longer be edited. It is also 
    impossible now to insert rows into an unused toplevel menu. To enable
    these operations, an unused toplevel menu has now to be explicitly 
    converted into a visible or an invisible toplevel menu.
  * Code cleanup.

0.3.4 2010-11-17

  * Added the option to draw rows in alternating colours (the currently 
    activated GTK theme has to support this).
  * Added the possiblity to keep the highlighting for unused and invisible
    toplevel menus if the toplevel menu status column is shown.
  * If highlighting for unused and invisible toplevel menus is activated, 
    the contrast between both menu types is now sharper.
  * Minor/cosmetical changes.

0.3.3 2010-11-17

  * Changed "show grid" sub menu to radio buttons because there is always 
    only exactly one possible choice.

0.3.2 2010-11-16

  * Bugfix - If a row was deleted and had at least one child that was not 
    selected for deletion and was a menu or pipe menu, the menu ID of this 
    child was not removed.
  * Bugfix - If the statuses of several toplevel menus were changed to 
    unused at the same time by multiple selection and at least one of the 
    menus had children, the list of the to be deleted children wasn't reset 
    after the children of the first toplevel menu that had any of them 
    were deleted. 
    Code of this section has been rewritten and is now much more compact.
  * Bugfix (regression) - If a new grid display option is selected after a 
    previous choice, the check mark of the new choice is displayed in the 
    menu again.
  * Bugfix - Allocated RAM for tree selection and row reference lists is 
    now freed throughout the program.
  * Minor/cosmetical changes and code cleanup.

0.3.1 2010-11-14

  * If a menu element is deleted from a menu that has not been previously
    edited, the "deleted" toolbar button will be deactivated, since there 
    is no current selection after the deletion.

0.3 2010-11-12

  * Code optimisations, incl. faster cell rendering.

0.3 Beta 2 2010-11-11

  * Empty Execute and startupnotify actions are now expanded if options are 
    added to them.
  * Bugfix (regression) - Reinserted default dummy value for action combo 
    box, otherwise an insertion of a Reconfigure action before a first use 
    of the combo box leads to a crash.
  * Bugfix (regression) - If one option of Execute was missing and a button 
    to add the missing option was clicked, a combo box without content was 
    shown instead of inserting the option.

0.3 Beta 2010-11-11

  * New functionality: Editable cells
  * Bugfix - When no menu had been found after the start of the program, a 
    rightclick on the empty treeview resulted in a crash.

0.2.3 2010-11-10

  * Bugfix (regression) - Insertion of Execute options by combo box works 
    again.

0.2.2 2010-11-09

  * Bugfix (regression) - Check for double Menu IDs works again.

0.2.1 2010-11-09

  * Bugfix (regression) - It was not possible to insert pipe menus, the last
    chosen element was inserted again instead.

0.2 2010-11-07

  * Makefile now contains install and uninstall options.

0.2 Beta 2 2010-11-06

  * Slightly enhanced makefile that supports several jobs at the same time 
    (make -j option) and clean option.
  * Switched to a much shorter way to check if X is running which also works on BSDs.
  * FreeBSD binaries for x86 and amd64 added.

0.2 Beta 2010-11-04

  * Added context menus.
  * Removed the possibilty to add menu elements at toplevel when several 
    menu elements are selected, since this is no action that would be 
    considered when selecting multiple elements and could even be confusing.
  * Fixed several bugs.

0.1 2010-11-02

  * Minor optimisation.

0.1 Beta 2 2010-10-31

  * Fixed wrong selection after addition of new actions.

0.1 Beta 2010-10-29

  * Minor/cosmetical changes.

0.1 Alpha 2 Revised 2010-10-27

  * Split up code for a better overview.
  * Included a simple makefile for easier compiling.

0.1 Alpha 2 2010-10-25

  * Fixed realloc crash that happened when a menu was loaded on x86 machines.
  * Faster xml parsing.

0.1 Alpha 2010-10-24

  * Initial release.
